We help our customers take advantage of the latest technology to take control of their spend and work to both reduce costs and improve the sustainability of their purchases. Spendency now has over 100 customers, including many of Sweden's largest and most demanding organizations. 

We are a relatively small team but are now entering a phase of accelerating expansion as part of our joining Onventis and therefore need to employ driven people who can grow together with the product and be ready to take responsibility in our continued growth journey.

Although we deliver a high-tech solution, our culture and our way of working is based on putting people in focus. Through trust, commitment and helpfulness, we all work actively to be an organization where everyone is given the best opportunity to be challenged and grow. We are very excited about the work we do, the customers we help and the opportunities we see ahead of us, and we look forward to bringing more people with us on our continued journey.

About the development team

The team has a long history of working with agile. You will enter a well-oiled machine, where both processes and tools work, so you can to devote yourself to building new fun code, and not fight to make things work.

We like to bring in new technology, and learning from each other is the best thing we know. All developers have a background in various open source projects, such as the Spring Framework, so it is really appreciated when you come up with new ideas - and ideas on how we can use new fun technology.

We work in short sprints, so what you build will immediately get into the hands of users who really appreciate what we do. Of course, we work with CI and Devops, so going from code to production is a matter of minutes.

We want you to grow in this role. Maybe you're a code wizard that just blazes through bug fixes. Or you are the strategic thinker, who sees the possibility of simplifying and reusing code. Maybe you are the one who has an eye for how the web pages should be designed, so they are both pretty and easy to use. Together, we will ensure that you develop into someone who has a prominent role in the team and who will have responsibility for entire user stories and work on them together with the rest of the team.

We think it's fun to come to work every day, and we think you will too!

About The AI Product

We are looking to expand our AI offerings to include spend analytics in many more languages and regions. Working with natural language processing in new markets will be a fun new challenge.

We are looking to build new AI powered insights into patterns, behaviors and trends, both for individual companies to help them work more efficiently, and to identify broader trends withing the industry as a whole. Onventis Analytics has access to a wonderfully broad dataset, across many customers in different industry and government areas.

","Spendency is the Nordic region's leading SaaS service in spend analysis – and now the new Onventis Analytics. We help our customers take advantage of the latest technology to take control of their spend and work to both reduce costs and improve the sustainability of their purchases. Spendency now has over 100 customers, including many of Sweden's largest and most demanding organizations. 

We are a relatively small team but are now entering a phase of accelerating expansion as part of our joining Onventis and therefore need to employ driven people who can grow together with the product and be ready to take responsibility in our continued growth journey.

Although we deliver a high-tech solution, our culture and our way of working is based on putting people in focus. Through trust, commitment and helpfulness, we all work actively to be an organization where everyone is given the best opportunity to be challenged and grow. We are very excited about the work we do, the customers we help and the opportunities we see ahead of us, and we look forward to bringing more people with us on our continued journey.

About the development team

The team has a long history of working with agile. You will enter a well-oiled machine, where both processes and tools work, so you can to devote yourself to building new fun code, and not fight to make things work.

We like to bring in new technology, and learning from each other is the best thing we know. All developers have a background in various open source projects, such as the Spring Framework, so it is really appreciated when you come up with new ideas - and ideas on how we can use new fun technology.

We work in short sprints, so what you build will immediately get into the hands of users who really appreciate what we do. Of course, we work with CI and Devops, so going from code to production is a matter of minutes.

We want you to grow in this role. Maybe you're a code wizard that just blazes through bug fixes. Or you are the strategic thinker, who sees the possibility of simplifying and reusing code. Maybe you are the one who has an eye for how the web pages should be designed, so they are both pretty and easy to use. Together, we will ensure that you develop into someone who has a prominent role in the team and who will have responsibility for entire user stories and work on them together with the rest of the team.

We think it's fun to come to work every day, and we think you will too!

We are looking to expand our AI offerings to include spend analytics in many more languages and regions. Working with natural language processing in new markets will be a fun new challenge.

We are looking to build new AI powered insights into patterns, behaviors and trends, both for individual companies to help them work more efficiently, and to identify broader trends withing the industry as a whole.

- Creating your network of leads (using internal team and personal activities, such as networking events);

**Here are a few things we want to see in our ideal candidate:**
- Proficiency in English is a must, as it’s our primer language for communication, documentation, and all things work-related.
- Understanding of B2B world - reaching out to business decision-makers is different from reaching out to consumers, so you need to know who your prospects are and what they care about.

- Ok, let’s get over the details (mind that you will have a sales assistant working closely with you and helping you with the majority of the tasks):
- Answering inbound requests (from leads who are already interested and approached us themselves);
- Building a sales pipeline to ensure a constant stream of sales;
- Following up leads from our CRM (whom we’ve already talked to);
- Creating your network of leads (using internal team and personal activities, such as networking events);
- Finalizing sales proposals;
- Closing the deal ;

**Here are a few things we want to see in our ideal candidate:**
- Proficiency in English is a must, as it’s our primer language for communication, documentation, and all things work-related.
- Understanding of B2B world - reaching out to business decision-makers is different from reaching out to consumers, so you need to know who your prospects are and what they care about.

**It would be a bonus:**
- Experience in selling digital services to the foreign B2B market;
- Soft skills: creative thinking, perseverance, problem-solving, communication.
- Experience working in the marketing industry;
- LinkedIn user experience;

**What are the responsibilities:**
- You will receive both inbound and outbound types of leads, and we expect you to..close them :)
- Ok, let’s get over the details (mind that you will have a sales assistant working closely with you and helping you with the majority of the tasks):
- Answering inbound requests (from leads who are already interested and approached us themselves);
- Building a sales pipeline to ensure a constant stream of sales;
- Following up leads from our CRM (whom we’ve already talked to);
- Creating your network of leads (using internal team and personal activities, such as networking events);
- Finalizing sales proposals;
- Closing the deal ;

**Working with us you get:**
- Comfortable office in the city center (10 min walking to Rynok square).
- A friendly, yet professional team, full of interesting personalities whom it will be a pleasure to spend time with;
- Ability to work remotely and with flexible schedules;
- Opportunity to grow quickly as a professional in various areas. Our projects are far from being standard, so you will have a huge space to showcase your creativity;
- A wide variety of tools to work with;
